Yes, the steps you have taken are excellent for improving the security of your VPS. Let's break them down and evaluate their effectiveness:

* * * * *

### **1\. Disabled Root Login via SSH**

**What you did:** Disabled direct access to the `root` account over SSH.

-   **Why it's correct:**

    -   Direct root login is a common target for brute-force attacks.
    -   By requiring attackers to compromise a non-root user first, you've added a layer of security.
-   **How to verify:** Check your SSH configuration file:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

    Ensure these lines are set:

    plaintext

    Copy code

    `PermitRootLogin no`

    Restart SSH:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

* * * * *

### **2\. Changed the Default Root Password**

**What you did:** Changed the root account's password.

-   **Why it's correct:**

    -   Even though you disabled root login, changing the root password ensures that no old or weak credentials remain usable. This is important for system recovery scenarios where root access might be required locally.
-   **Additional Recommendation:** You can lock the root account to ensure it cannot be used, even locally:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo passwd -l root`

    You can still access root with `sudo su` from your non-root user.

* * * * *

### **3\. Removed the Default User**

**What you did:** Deleted the pre-configured `ubuntu` or default user.

-   **Why it's correct:**

    -   Default users like `ubuntu` are often pre-configured with known credentials or weak defaults, making them a potential security risk.
    -   By removing this account, you've eliminated a common attack vector.
-   **How to verify:** List all users to confirm the default user is gone:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cat /etc/passwd`

* * * * *

### **4\. Created a New Non-Root User**

**What you did:** Created a new user for regular use and administrative tasks via `sudo`.

-   **Why it's correct:**

    -   A non-root user minimizes the risk of accidental or malicious system-wide changes.
    -   Using `sudo` allows for controlled access to administrative privileges.
-   **Additional Recommendations for the New User:**

    -   **Set up SSH keys for login:** Replace password authentication with SSH keys for added security:

        bash

        Copy code

        `ssh-keygen
        ssh-copy-id your-new-user@your-server-ip`

    -   **Disable password login:** Update the SSH configuration file to disable password authentication:

        bash

        Copy code

        `PasswordAuthentication no`

        Restart SSH:

        bash

        Copy code

        `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

* * * * *

### **Final Checklist**

Here's a quick checklist to ensure your VPS is fully secured:

1.  **Firewall Configuration:** Enable and configure `ufw`:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw enable`

2.  **Fail2Ban Installation:** Protect against brute-force attacks:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install fail2ban`

3.  **Keep the System Updated:** Regularly update your packages:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`

4.  **Monitor Logs for Intrusions:** Check authentication logs:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/auth.log`

* * * * *

### **Conclusion**

Yes, the steps you took are correct and show good security practices. Disabling root access, removing the default user, and creating a new, secure user significantly enhance your server's security. Keep following these practices, and your VPS will remain well-protected!
