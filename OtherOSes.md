when you say After CentOS ended stable support do you mean that it is not recommended any more because I was going to try it but I think I am going with solaris

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes, CentOS is indeed in a different place than it used to be. In December 2020, Red Hat announced a shift for CentOS from being a stable downstream version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to a "rolling-release" model called **CentOS Stream**. This change means that CentOS Stream now sits between Fedora (Red Hat's development OS) and RHEL, effectively making it more of a testing ground for the next version of RHEL rather than a stable, production-ready OS.

Here's a breakdown of the implications:

-   **CentOS Linux (Traditional)**: Previously, CentOS Linux was a stable, reliable clone of RHEL, which made it ideal for production environments. This version received long-term support, but the CentOS 8 version's support was cut short and officially ended at the end of 2021.
-   **CentOS Stream**: Now, CentOS Stream continuously receives updates that are ahead of RHEL releases. It's more of a preview OS for what's coming to RHEL, making it less predictable and less stable for critical production environments.

### Is CentOS Still Recommended?

For critical production servers or environments requiring stability, **CentOS Stream** is not generally recommended. If you want the same stability CentOS was known for, alternatives like **Rocky Linux** and **AlmaLinux** were created specifically to fill this gap. Both are downstream of RHEL and aim to replicate the old CentOS model of stability and long-term support.

### Should You Go with Solaris?

**Oracle Solaris** is still highly respected in enterprise environments, especially where high availability, security, and performance are crucial. It is widely used in sectors like finance, telecommunications, and scientific computing. Here are a few key things about Solaris:

-   **Advantages**: Known for its stability, advanced file system (ZFS), and scalability, Solaris performs well on high-end hardware and supports enterprise-grade applications.
-   **Downsides**: Solaris has a smaller community, fewer third-party applications, and less compatibility with modern open-source tools compared to Linux. Additionally, Oracle's licensing for Solaris can be expensive and restrictive.

If you're building a system where uptime, data integrity, and high reliability are paramount, Solaris could be a good choice. However, for more general-purpose use cases or cloud-native applications, a Linux-based system (like Ubuntu Server, RHEL, or a RHEL-compatible system like Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux) may be more versatile and cost-effective.

### Recommendation

For most standard server environments, a stable Linux distribution like **Rocky Linux**, **AlmaLinux**, or **Ubuntu Server** will provide better flexibility, community support, and ease of use. However, if you have specific needs that align well with Solaris' strengths, especially in an enterprise environment with high performance and security demands, **Solaris** could be an excellent fit.

is there any way to get oracle solaris without signing up for oracle account?

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Unfortunately, **Oracle requires an account** for most downloads, including Solaris, as it has strict licensing and access controls around its software. Even for trial or development use, Oracle typically requires users to log in to an Oracle account to access the Solaris installation files.

However, here are a few alternatives you might consider:

1.  **Oracle Solaris Express**: While older versions of Solaris (like Solaris Express 11, which Oracle released for developers in 2010) used to be freely available, Oracle has since removed most public access to these. Occasionally, older ISOs may be found in archives or third-party repositories, but using these can be risky as they might lack security updates and could violate Oracle's licensing policies.

2.  **OpenSolaris and Illumos**:

    -   **OpenSolaris**: The original open-source version of Solaris, OpenSolaris, was discontinued after Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems. However, OpenSolaris gave rise to **Illumos**, an open-source Solaris derivative.
    -   **Illumos-Based Distributions**: Distributions like **OpenIndiana**, **SmartOS**, and **Tribblix** are based on Illumos and retain many of Solaris' core features, including the ZFS file system and DTrace. These are open-source and can be freely downloaded without an Oracle account, offering Solaris-like functionality.
3.  **Development and Test Environments**:

    -   If you're specifically looking to test or develop on Solaris for educational purposes or to understand its features, Illumos-based distributions are usually sufficient and quite close to Solaris in functionality.

### Summary

If Oracle Solaris itself is essential for your needs, you will need an Oracle account to access it. However, if you're interested in Solaris-like functionality and tools, Illumos-based distributions like **OpenIndiana** or **SmartOS** could provide a similar experience without the need to register with Oracle.
