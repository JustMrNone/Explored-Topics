The `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` setting in Django is important when your Django application is behind a reverse proxy, such as NGINX, that terminates SSL/TLS connections (handles the HTTPS encryption) on behalf of Django. The reverse proxy forwards the traffic to Django over HTTP, but it still needs to pass along information about the original HTTPS request from the client, so Django can handle it appropriately.

### What `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` Does:

When your application is behind a reverse proxy (like NGINX), the proxy itself typically terminates the SSL connection and forwards the traffic to your application over HTTP. The `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is used to indicate the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that the client originally used to make the request.

By setting the `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` in your Django `settings.py`:

python

Copy code

`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')`

You're telling Django to check for the `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP header, which is passed by the proxy (NGINX in your case), and to treat the request as being HTTPS if the header contains `https`.

### How it works:

1.  **Client Request**: The user makes a request to `https://quantum-co.dev`.

2.  **NGINX Handles SSL**: NGINX accepts the HTTPS request, decrypts it, and forwards the traffic to Django over HTTP. The `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is added to the request by NGINX, which will contain the value `https`, because the original request was made using HTTPS.

3.  **Django Receives the Request**: Django, running behind NGINX, receives the HTTP request. Normally, Django would think the request came via HTTP because it's receiving the traffic over HTTP from the proxy, but with the `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` setting, Django checks the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to determine that the original request was over HTTPS.

4.  **Security Redirects**: Because the header indicates that the original request was over HTTPS, Django can properly handle any security-related settings like `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` and `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`, which rely on knowing whether the request was originally secure or not.

### Why It's Necessary:

When you're using a reverse proxy like NGINX, the traffic between NGINX and Django is typically over HTTP. Without this setting, Django wouldn't know that the original request was HTTPS, and it could potentially allow insecure communication even when HTTPS was used. By configuring `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`, you're ensuring that Django will recognize secure requests and enforce security measures (such as `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` or `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`).

### In Summary:

The `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')` setting helps Django correctly detect whether the client made a secure (HTTPS) request, even when it is behind a reverse proxy that terminates SSL/TLS. It ensures that security features (like HTTPS redirects and HSTS) work properly when the traffic is proxied.
