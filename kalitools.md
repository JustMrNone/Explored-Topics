### Key Command: `sudo apt install kali-linux-everything`

If you have installed a lighter version of Kali (like the default or minimal), you can upgrade it to include **everything** using the following command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install kali-linux-everything`

This command installs the **"kali-linux-everything" metapackage**, which pulls in every available tool from Kali's repositories.

### Other Useful Metapackages

If you don't want **everything** but need specific categories of tools, Kali provides **metapackages** for different purposes. Here are some common ones:

#### 1\. **Install All Tools**:

bash

Copy code

`sudo apt install kali-linux-large`

Installs a large set of tools, but not as many as "everything."

#### 2\. **Category-Specific Toolsets**:

Kali organizes tools into categories, which can be installed individually:

-   **Wireless tools**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install kali-tools-wireless`

-   **Web application tools**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install kali-tools-web`

-   **Password attacks**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install kali-tools-passwords`

-   **Forensics tools**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install kali-tools-forensics`

-   **Exploitation tools**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo apt install kali-tools-exploitation`

-   **And many more**: Use `apt search kali-tools` to find all available categories.

### Summary

-   Run `sudo apt install kali-linux-everything` to install every tool in Kali.
-   For specific needs, use targeted metapackages like `kali-tools-web` or `kali-tools-wireless`.
-   Use the default installation for a lean setup and add tools as required.

Yes, **`sudo apt install kali-linux-everything`** will install all the category-specific toolsets because it is the **superset of all Kali metapackages**. Here's how it works:

### How "Everything" Works:

The **`kali-linux-everything`** metapackage:

-   Depends on all the category-specific toolsets (like `kali-tools-web`, `kali-tools-wireless`, etc.).
-   Ensures every tool available in the Kali repositories gets installed.

### Included Toolsets:

When you run `kali-linux-everything`, it pulls in all these metapackages (and more):

-   **kali-tools-top10** (Top 10 most-used tools)
-   **kali-tools-web**
-   **kali-tools-wireless**
-   **kali-tools-exploitation**
-   **kali-tools-passwords**
-   **kali-tools-forensics**
-   **kali-tools-reporting**
-   **kali-tools-sniffing-spoofing**
-   And others in the **`kali-tools-*`** series.

It also includes additional tools and dependencies that aren't part of specific categories but are still part of the "everything" package.

* * * * *

### Alternative: Install Specific Toolsets Only

If you don't need every tool, you can selectively install only the categories you want (e.g., `kali-tools-web` for web application testing).

* * * * *

### Storage and Time Consideration

-   **Disk Space**: The "everything" package will take up significant storage (50GB+).
-   **Install Time**: It can take a long time depending on your internet speed.

For most users, installing specific toolsets or the `kali-linux-large` package is a more efficient choice.
