Connecting to a VPS using a VPN involves setting up a VPN server on your VPS and then configuring your local device to connect to it. Here's a step-by-step guide:

* * * * *

### **1\. Set Up a VPN Server on the VPS**

You need to install and configure VPN software on your VPS. Common options include:

#### **Option 1: OpenVPN**

1.  **Install OpenVPN**:

    -   On Ubuntu/Debian:

        bash

        Copy code

        `sudo apt update
        sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa -y`

    -   On CentOS/RHEL:

        bash

        Copy code

        `sudo yum install epel-release -y
        sudo yum install openvpn easy-rsa -y`

2.  **Use a Script for Simplified Setup**:

    -   Use a third-party OpenVPN installation script like [Nyr's OpenVPN script](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install):

        bash

        Copy code

        `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nyr/openvpn-install/master/openvpn-install.sh

        sudo ./openvpn-install.sh`

    -   Follow the interactive prompts to configure OpenVPN.
3.  **Download the VPN Client Configuration File**:

    -   The script will generate a `.ovpn` file (e.g., `client.ovpn`).
    -   Use `scp` or a file transfer tool to download this file to your local device:

        bash

        Copy code

        `scp user@your_vps_ip:/path/to/client.ovpn ~/Downloads/`

4.  **Start the VPN Server**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
    sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server`

#### **Option 2: WireGuard**

1.  **Install WireGuard**:

    -   On Ubuntu:

        bash

        Copy code

        `sudo apt update
        sudo apt install wireguard -y`

    -   On CentOS:

        bash

        Copy code

        `sudo yum install epel-release -y
        sudo yum install wireguard-tools -y`

2.  **Simplify Setup Using a Script**:

    -   Use the [WireGuard installation script](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install):

        bash

        Copy code

        `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh
        chmod +x wireguard-install.sh
        sudo ./wireguard-install.sh`

    -   Follow the interactive prompts.
3.  **Download the Configuration File**:

    -   The script will generate a config file (e.g., `client.conf`).
    -   Transfer it to your local device (use `scp` or a similar tool).
4.  **Start the WireGuard Server**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
    sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0`

* * * * *

### **2\. Configure Your Local Device to Connect to the VPN**

#### **For OpenVPN**:

1.  Install an OpenVPN client:

Which protocol should OpenVPN use? 1) UDP (recommended) 2) TCP

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The choice between **UDP** and **TCP** depends on your needs, but generally, **UDP** is recommended for most VPN setups, including OpenVPN. Here's why:

* * * * *

### **1\. UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

-   **Recommended for Most Cases**: OpenVPN works more efficiently with UDP because it is faster and has lower latency.
-   **No Error Correction**: Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't check for errors or retransmit lost packets. This makes it ideal for real-time applications (e.g., gaming, streaming, and VoIP) where speed is more important than reliability.
-   **Best for Stable Connections**: If your network connection is stable, UDP will provide better performance for VPN traffic.

* * * * *

### **2\. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

-   **Use if UDP Fails**: TCP can be a fallback option if UDP traffic is blocked by a firewall or if you're on a highly unreliable network.
-   **Error Correction and Reliability**: TCP ensures every packet is delivered correctly, which can lead to more stable connections but with increased latency and slower performance.
-   **Good for Firewalled Networks**: TCP is often used when VPN traffic needs to pass through restrictive firewalls, as it uses port 443 (same as HTTPS) to blend in with regular web traffic.

* * * * *

### **Which Should You Choose?**

1.  **UDP**:

    -   Use it unless you're dealing with specific network restrictions.
    -   It's faster, making it ideal for most VPN users.
2.  **TCP**:

    -   Use it if you experience connectivity issues, frequent packet loss, or are behind strict firewalls.

* * * * *

When setting up OpenVPN, select **UDP** first (Option 1). You can always reconfigure it later to TCP if necessary.

##### You said:

which port

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

When setting up OpenVPN, the **port** you choose depends on your specific use case. Here are the recommended options:

* * * * *

### **Default Ports for OpenVPN**

1.  **UDP (Default)**: **1194**

    -   This is the default port for OpenVPN when using UDP.
    -   Most firewalls and ISPs allow traffic on this port, so it's a good starting point.
2.  **TCP (Alternative)**: **443**

    -   If you're using TCP or need to bypass restrictive firewalls, port **443** is ideal.
    -   It is commonly used for HTTPS traffic, so it is unlikely to be blocked.

* * * * *

### **Customizing the Port**

-   **Why Customize?**
    -   To avoid detection or throttling by ISPs.
    -   To circumvent network restrictions or prevent interference with other services using the default ports.
-   You can choose any unused port (e.g., **1195**, **8080**, or **53**) if you have specific requirements.

* * * * *

### **Best Practice**

1.  Use **UDP 1194** for general use unless you have issues.
2.  If UDP is blocked or you need to tunnel through firewalls, use **TCP 443**.

* * * * *

### **How to Specify the Port in OpenVPN Configuration**

In the OpenVPN server configuration file (`server.conf` or `openvpn.conf`), set the port like this:

bash

Copy code

`port 1194
proto udp  # Use "tcp" if choosing TCP`

For the client configuration (`client.ovpn`), match the server:

bash

Copy code

`remote your-vps-ip 1194 udp`

* * * * *

Select a DNS server for the clients: 1) Current system resolvers 2) Google 3) 1.1.1.1 4) OpenDNS 5) Quad9 6) AdGuard DNS server [1]:

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Choosing a DNS server for your VPN clients depends on your priorities, such as speed, privacy, and security. Here's a breakdown of the options:

* * * * *

### **DNS Options Explained**

1.  **Current System Resolvers**:

    -   Uses the DNS servers already configured on the VPS.
    -   Pros: Simple and uses your existing setup.
    -   Cons: If the system resolvers are slow or unreliable, clients will inherit those issues.
2.  **Google DNS** (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4):

    -   Pros: Very fast and reliable.
    -   Cons: Google collects some data, which might be a privacy concern.
3.  **1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare)**:

    -   Pros: Fast, secure, and privacy-focused (doesn't log personally identifiable data).
    -   Cons: Not as widely recognized as Google, but an excellent choice.
4.  **OpenDNS** (208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220):

    -   Pros: Reliable and offers optional filtering features (e.g., blocking malicious domains).
    -   Cons: Filtering might be a downside for those who prefer no interference.
5.  **Quad9** (9.9.9.9):

    -   Pros: Focuses on security, blocking access to known malicious sites.
    -   Cons: May block legitimate sites if they're incorrectly flagged.
6.  **AdGuard DNS**:

    -   Pros: Blocks ads and trackers by default, enhancing privacy.
    -   Cons: May block some legitimate services inadvertently.

* * * * *

### **Recommendation**

-   **For General Use**: **1.1.1.1** (Cloudflare) is an excellent all-around choice for speed and privacy.
-   **For Enhanced Security**: **Quad9** or **AdGuard** offers robust protection against malicious sites and trackers.
-   **For Simplicity**: If you're unsure, **Google DNS** is a reliable default.

* * * * *

how to knowif port is in use

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To check if a port is in use on your system, you can use the `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof` commands. Here's how you can do it:

* * * * *

### **1\. Using `netstat`**

Run the following command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo netstat -tuln | grep <port_number>`

-   Replace `<port_number>` with the port you want to check, e.g., `1194` for OpenVPN.
-   Explanation of the options:
    -   `-t`: Show TCP connections.
    -   `-u`: Show UDP connections.
    -   `-l`: Show listening ports.
    -   `-n`: Show numerical addresses and ports.

**Example Output**:

bash

Copy code

`udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1194            0.0.0.0:*                           1234/process-name`

This indicates the port is in use by a process.

* * * * *

### **2\. Using `ss` (Socket Statistics)**

Run this command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo ss -tuln | grep <port_number>`

-   This tool works similarly to `netstat` but is faster and more modern.

**Example Output**:

bash

Copy code

`udp   UNCONN 0      0         0.0.0.0:1194          0.0.0.0:*`

This shows that the port is in use by a service.

* * * * *

### **3\. Using `lsof` (List Open Files)**

Run the following command:

bash

Copy code

`sudo lsof -i :<port_number>`

-   Replace `<port_number>` with the port number you're checking.

**Example Output**:

bash

Copy code

`COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
process   1234 root   10u  IPv4  12345      0t0  UDP *:1194`

This indicates which process (e.g., `process`) is using the port.

* * * * *

### **4\. If the Port is in Use**

-   **Identify the Process ID (PID)**:

    -   Look for the `PID` (e.g., `1234`) in the output of `netstat`, `ss`, or `lsof`.
-   **Stop the Conflicting Process**:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo kill <PID>`

    Replace `<PID>` with the process ID.

-   **Alternatively, Change the Port**:

    -   If the port is in use and you can't stop the process, change the port in the OpenVPN configuration file (`server.conf`) and restart OpenVPN.

* * * * *

If you need help analyzing the output or resolving port conflicts, feel free to share the results!

sudo netstat -tuln | grep 1194 udp 0 0 148.113.205.147:1194 0.0.0.0:*

###### ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

The output confirms that **UDP port 1194** is already in use on your server by a process bound to the IP address `148.113.205.147`. This could mean:

1.  An existing OpenVPN process is already running on this port.
2.  Another application is using this port.

* * * * *

### **Steps to Resolve**

#### **1\. Identify the Process Using Port 1194**

Use the `lsof` or `ss` command to identify the specific process:

bash

Copy code

`sudo lsof -i:1194`

or

bash

Copy code

`sudo ss -tuln | grep 1194`

**Example Output**:

text

Copy code

`COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
openvpn   1234  root   10u  IPv4 123456      0t0  UDP *:1194`

-   **COMMAND**: The process name (e.g., `openvpn`).
-   **PID**: The process ID (e.g., `1234`).

#### **2\. Stop the Conflicting Process**

If the process is OpenVPN and it's stuck or an old instance is running, stop it:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl stop openvpn@server`

#### **3\. Kill the Process (If Necessary)**

If stopping the service doesn't work, kill the process manually:

bash

Copy code

`sudo kill <PID>`

Replace `<PID>` with the process ID found in step 1.

* * * * *

### **4\. Restart OpenVPN**

After resolving the conflict, restart OpenVPN:

bash

Copy code

`sudo systemctl restart openvpn@server`

* * * * *

### **5\. Change the Port (Optional)**

If you cannot stop the conflicting process or need to avoid conflicts, change the OpenVPN port in `/etc/openvpn/server/server.conf`:

1.  Open the configuration file:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server/server.conf`

2.  Update the `port` line to a new port, such as `1195`:

    text

    Copy code

    `port 1195`

3.  Restart OpenVPN:

    bash

    Copy code

    `sudo systemctl restart openvpn@server`

* * * * *

If you still face issues or need help analyzing the process, let me know the output of the `lsof` or `ss` commands!
